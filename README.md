* Mini-Chat is still in its Alpha stage, so there may be bugs!

### Get Started
You can get help with the program, and information on how to set it up on our wiki page [here](https://gitlab.com/noahmarshall12/minichat/-/wikis/home).

### Official Chat Server
You can use the configuration below if you want to connect to our official server.
First 2 lines of `settings.txt`:
```
7319
minichat.n4t.co
```
If it doesn't work, it probably means the server/host is down, contains the max amount of users or you are ip banned.
