### Disclaimers
* If something breaks, it's not our fault. We'll try our best to help, but it isn't our job to make everything perfect for you.
* All data transmitted and logged on your servers or systems is your fault, so if anything illegal happens don't come to us about it.
* Any issues with QB64 itself should be dealt with the proper team/developers - *not us*.
* Mini-Chat is still in its Beta stage, so there may be bugs!
* There might be NO more updates now, because of the inactivity. If you like to support the program, you need to learn QB64, and then you can fork the program.
